# AI USAGE DOCUMENTATION:
#
# AI Tool Used: GitHub Copilot
#
# Specific AI Assistance:
# - Prompt: "Help me implement a user login system with JSON file storage"
#   AI provided: Basic structure for load_user_data() and save_user_data() functions
#   My contribution: Modified to include grand champion tracking and games played counter
#
# - Prompt: "Add speed bonuses for fast quiz answers"  
#   AI provided: Timer logic using time.time() 
#   My contribution: Set 10-second threshold, added emoji feedback, integrated with scoring
#
# - Prompt: "Help me consolidate and clean up my code"
#   AI provided: Suggestions to remove unused functions
#   My contribution: Decided which functions to keep, maintained code organization
#
# Student Work (No AI):
# - All 5 history questions were written by me
# - Quiz topic selection (history theme)
# - Variable naming conventions
# - Testing and debugging
# - Overall program design decisions

# Import required libraries for randomization, timing, JSON file handling, and alphabet letters
